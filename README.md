[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

A typing tutor inspired by gtypist and keybr.com

### Usage

To run it from console type:
`python pytypist.py`


### Possible problems

This is still a very early stage of developement, so expect bugs. Was written and tested only on linux with python 3.8 so this configuration is your best bet.
